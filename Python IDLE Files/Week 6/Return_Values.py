# Often a function will take its arguments, do some computation, and "return" a value
# to be used as the value of the function call in the "calling expression".
# The "return" keyword is used for this.

def greet() :   
    return 'Hello'              # returns 'Hello',

print(greet(), "Glenn")         # Hello is returned(), "Glenn"
