# THIS IS LOOPS + WHile Loop
    

import time

counter = 1
while counter < 11:
    print(counter)
    time.sleep(.5)
    counter = counter +1 # add # to beginning of this line to run Infinite loop 
    time.sleep(.5)
else:               # I added this to show completion after the "infinite" loop
                    #below was added
    print("complete")


#Now delete the “counter = counter + 1” and run the code.
#As you can see, without exact instructions, the loop will continue on forever,
#and we do not want to get stuck in an infinite loop!
#You can stop it by exiting the program. (Ctrl+C)
