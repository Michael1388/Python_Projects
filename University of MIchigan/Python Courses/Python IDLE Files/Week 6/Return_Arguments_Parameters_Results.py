#residual value is w
from hashlib import _BlakeHash


big = max('Hello world') # 'Hello world' is the 'Argument' of the (Parameter)..ya know thingy....
print(big)
#returns w <- W is the residual value bc the max "function" define is designed to return what it (max) is designed to return, in this case the largest charachter in the argument input

#basically what is inside max is
def max(inp) :
    blah
    blah
for x in inp:
    _blah
    blah
#return (max =)'w'
