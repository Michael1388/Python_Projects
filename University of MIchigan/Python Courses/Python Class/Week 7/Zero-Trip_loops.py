#Zero-trip loops never run the loop, they skip over and go to the next code section 

n = 0                   # this is 0 instead of 5 as in the last exercises
while n > 0 :           # This statement is false and will never execute 
    print('Lather')     
    print('Rinse') 
    
print('DRY off!')
