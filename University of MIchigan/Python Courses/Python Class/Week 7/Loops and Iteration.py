# the work computers that we humans don't wan to do over and over. This is the real power of computers
# Repeated steps
# Iteration variables
# Loops (repeated steps) have 'iteration variables' that change each time through a loop.
# Often these 'iteration variables'go through a sequence of numbers.

n = 5
while n > 0 :       # 'While' a new keyword that tells a sequence to repeat and rechecks the question unitl True changes to false then exits the code loop and goes to next code 
    print(n)        # While is like IF except that it continues in the loop until accomplished
    n = n - 1
print('Blastoff!')
print(n)

# Returns
#5        
#4        
#3        
#2        
#1        
#Blastoff!
