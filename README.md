[Check Files GUI | Python Tkinter](https://github.com/Michael1388/Python_Projects/tree/main/Exercises/Tkinter_Sqlite)
SCENARIO: Once per day, any files in the Customer Source directory that are new (or that were modified within the previous 24 hours) must be transferred into the Customer Destination folder. The process of figuring out which files are new or recently edited is currently being done manually. Your employer is now asking that once a day, the program automatically detects which files are new or have been modified within the last 24 hours and transfers them accordingly.

# Python Internship
## Django Web-Application
[TheCasualGardener.com](https://github.com/Michael1388/Python_Projects/tree/main/TheCasualGardener)
During a two-week internship with Prosper IT Consulting, I participated in the creation of a database-driven Django web application using Python. The internship gave me experience using the Agile/Scrum methodology and Azure DevOps. I was given a minimum of 4 stories to complete, and additional optional stories to complete over the course of a two-week sprint time permitting. I completed the first four and an additional three including a RESTful API.
